# Testing

## Commands

```bash
npm run test           # Run once
npm run test:watch     # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # With coverage
```

## Conventions

- Co-locate tests with source: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Write tests alongside implementation, not after
- 80% coverage required before marking task complete
